1,"I was impressed with the quality and thoroughness of the NUI Galway's MSc (Business Analytics) program and the enthusiasm of the students. Not only does the program teach the important fundamentals of business analytics, big data and data science, but they encompass that learning within a broader design thinking approach that seeks to get the most out of every student. The success of the program speaks for itself in the number of students who are placed in high positions of responsibility at some of the leading companies throughout Ireland and the EU.","Bill Schmarzo (CTO, IOT AND ANALYTICS, HITACHI VANTARA HONORARY PROFESSOR)",https://www.universityofgalway.ie/courses/taught-postgraduate-courses/business-analytics.html,CODE1_CAREER_TRAJ
2,"Galway has a vibrant traditional Irish music scene and a history of producing some of the most successful traditional Irish musicians. De Dannan, were once based in Galway and other figures in traditional music like Dolores Keane, Frankie Gavin and Mairtin Oâ€™Connor, also hail from Galway. Popular bands including the The Saw Doctors and The Stunning, were formed in Galway too. The wealth of musicians performing on the streets and in local venues is a testament to the strong music scene here.",Galway Tourism Travel Guide,https://www.galwaytourism.ie/best-traditional-music-pubs/,CODE1_IRISH_HERITAGE
